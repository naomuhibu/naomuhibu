- 👋 Hi, I’m Naomi
- 🌱 My studies in cloud engineer at Yoobee College in New Zealand just started.
- 💻 I thoroughly enjoyed the process of developing my app short project https://github.com/naomuhibu/WhacACupcakes and visual effects, sound effects, and audio elements https://soundcloud.com/naomi-murachi-970979145/sets/lost-soulz-the-labyrinth-1 during final team game project in Unity https://github.com/jazman43/Lost-Souls-Project. I aspire to participate in creative endeavours in the future.
- 👀 My interest is in the cutting edge technology associated with IoT, and XR.
- 💞️ Music, baking, and designing are some of the creative activities I enjoy during my free time.
